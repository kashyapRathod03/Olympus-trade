                        3. Sufficient USDT for fuel fee (20% of your revenue) â€“ you are advised to keep at least 20 USDT in your RQ Wallet.<br /><br />
                        Please note that there might be a transaction fee from each transfer depending on the policy from each Exchange.<br />
                        You also need sufficient USDT in your Exchange account to keep the trade running. The first order is suggested to be 15 USDT. Insufficient USDT in your Exchange account would also cause the shutdown of your trade.<br /><br />
